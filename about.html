<p>When I got my very first dog, a cocker spaniel named Rio, I was excited, but I soon learned just how much work goes in to taking care of a dog and getting them to listen to you. I had a hard time looking after him, I didnâ€™t know what to give him for food as he did not like solid food but wet food gave him a bad stomach so I had to get him to eat the solid and he would always destroy my bed by trying to dig it up with his overgrown nails, and I did not know how to get him to stop. The only reason I manages the first few days was because I had friends and family, I could go to for advice on how to deal with him and get him to do what I say for example using treats as rewords.
	<br>
	
That is why I designed this web site so that I could pass on all the advice I was given by my friends as well as what I learned by myself in later years on to anyone thinking about getting a dog or have recently got one so as to make the first few weeks and months easier for you than they were for me. </p></div>
